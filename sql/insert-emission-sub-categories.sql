(1, 1, 'Energy - Fuel', 'Your school probably has one or several boilers or furnaces for heating. Boilers consume heating oil, natural gas or fuelwood to produce heat, and in the process emit large amounts of greenhouse gases.Record the quantity of fuel consumed in the course of one year by your school (for instance, January through December). The school might have a general bill or different bills. In the case of a general bill just insert the data in the fields below, in the case of different bills you’ll have to do some math and to check your results with your teacher. If you are considering periods of time shorter than a year you should be aware that time is relevant in this data and you should consider the seasonal variation when calculating an average.'),
(2, 1, 'Energy - Electricity', 'Your school is connected to the power grid in your country. Electricity is generated by nuclear power plants, coal-fired plants, hydropower dams, and is increasingly supplied by wind turbines, solar panels and other renewable energy installations. Record here the electricity consumption for your school (we suggest to insert records for one whole year, from January to December). The school should have an electricity bill (normally it is one for one year). It is country dependent and it should be automatic in the calculator - set when the teacher sets the country'),
(3, 1, 'Energy - Advanced', 'Your school undoubtedly has science labs equipped with bunsen burners that produce a flame by burning natural gas, and so they also emit greenhouse gases. For the purposes of your estimation, assume that 100% of the gas is consumed by the flame. Gather information on the amount of gas consumed for the science labs, workshops and other classroom activities, and enter the associated CO2 emissions. Your science lab should have its own bills on the gases that are used for the scientific experiments.');

Be sure you calculate the total number of meals for the entire year! We suggest you use the period January through December. Number of meals provided by the school divided into options. If your schools is not providing a food service you can still count the lunches you consume during the school year. In this way you’ll be able to compare your data at European level!'),

All the food that you eat there is brought in by various means of transport, which have emitted greenhouse gases. Record here the vehicles used to deliver food supplies to the canteen or cafeteria. Cover the whole year if you can! Pay attention to the units requested). Suppliers of food in your school, how do they deliver the food to the schools and for how many km do they travel.'),
(7, 2, 'Food - Organic Waste', 'You have certainly noticed that a lot of the food prepared for school meals is thrown away. And that''s not the end of it! The waste is dumped into big plastic bags, the bags are picked up by trucks and taken to various sites to be composted, incinerated or simply buried in a landfill. This all means more GHG emissions!'),

Distribute a questionnaire to all the students in the school to find out how many travel by car and how many by public transport or school bus. You will also need to know the distance travelled for each one-way trip. Once you have this information the distances must be broken down by type of vehicle (diesel or gasoline automobile, train, bus, etc.). Then you can fill out the cells below. Remember to check bus and train itineraries to accurately report the number of kilometres travelled.'),
(10, 3, 'Travel - Personnel', 'To go a bit farther, it would be interesting to record travel by school staff as well. As for students, a questionnaire is a good way to start collecting data for each type of travel.

(11, 3, 'Travel - School Trips', 'If your school organizes field trips this travel should be counted as well. Add up the distance travelled and multiply by the number of persons who take the trip.

Here you can report purchases of new equipment bought during the year of your inventory (you don''t need to report equipment purchases from earlier years).
